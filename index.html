        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        Although nations across the globe face numerous challenges, corruption has been identified as a major problem both
        developed and developing countries continue to contend with. Corruption scandals have surfaced in countries with
        different political systems and varying levels of income (Ades & Di Tella, 1997). Evidences of corruption, however,
        abound in developing countries and transition nations (Aidt, 2003). In addition, it has been established that corruption
        is not only widespread in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries, the economies and citizens of the region are the worst hit
        by corruption (Gyimah-Brempong, 2002; Gyimah-Brempong & de Camacho, 2006).
        <p>There are two opposing views on the role corruption plays on the economy of a country. The first group argued that
            corruption tends to slowdown economic growth via reduction in human capital development in the form less spending on
            education and healthcare, misallocation of resources, inadequate domestic investment, less provisions of social
            amenities and transfers to the poor, and high inequality and poverty, among other things (see Abu, karim & Aziz,
            2015a;
            Del Monte, & Papagni, 2007; Gupta, Davoodi, & Alonso-Terme, 2002; Gyimah-Brempong, 2002; Gyimah-Brempong & de
            Camacho,
            2006; Habib & Zurawicki, 2001; Mauro, 1995; Mo, 2001; Nguyen & van Dijk, 2012; Wei, 2000). On the other hand, a few
            researchers including Leff (1964) and Huntington (1968) opined that corruption promotes economic growth by
            increasing
            efficiency in countries where bureaucrats/government officials are inefficient and constitute barriers to investment
            growth. Thus, by bribing government or public officials, businessmen/investors spend less time in queue to obtain
            business permits and licences, including contract approvals. This leads to an increase in efficiency of the system,
            causing investment and production of goods and services to rise and consequently boosting economic growth.</p>
        <p>There is no consensus among economists on the precise or comprehensive definition of corruption (Aidt, 2003). The
            meaning of corruption differs from one place to the other, and what is considered as corruption in a particular
            society
            might be viewed as the norm in another (Gyimah-Brempong, 2002). For example, Transparency International sees
            corruption
            as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. On his part, Jain (2001) considered corruption as the use of the
            power
            of public office for personal gain in such a manner that contravenes the rules of the game. In addition, Jain (2001)
            categorised corruption into three namely – grand corruption which involves political elite, bureaucratic corruption
            which involves bureaucrats, and legislative corruption which involves how a legislator’s private interest influences
            legislative votes. These forms of corruption vary only in terms of the individual who engages in it. The consequence
            of
            any of this type of corruption is the same, and that is the misallocation of resources and reducing efficiency of
            the
            system (Gyimah-Brempong, 2002).</p>
        <p>Nigeria like many developing countries has continued to face many social and economic problems. These include poor
            public spending on education and healthcare, high unemployment, low incomes and high level of poverty, rising
            insecurity, kidnapping, cattle rustling, and cultism, to mention just a few. A major factor that has been blamed for
            the
            poor standards of living in Nigeria is the massive corruption in the public sector. For instance, Abu (2015)
            submitted
            that corruption is deep-rooted in almost every segment/section of the Nigerian economy including the various arms of
            government (that is, executive, legislature and judiciary). The ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) won the 2015
            and
            2019 Presidential elections on the promise that it will tackle corruption head-on, fight insecurity as well as
            developing the economy. In addition, the President (Muhammadu Buhari) has repeatedly said that ‘if Nigerians don’t
            kill
            corruption, corruption will kill Nigeria’. It is not surprising therefore, that the government is investigating
            alleged
            embezzlement of over $2billion that was meant to prosecute the war against insurgency and Boko-Haram by cabinet
            members
            and high-ranking government officials including political associates of the previous administration, the People’s
            Democratic Party (PDP). To this end, the former National Security Adviser (NSA) and Spokesperson of the PDP were
            apprehended and are currently standing trial. Similarly, the former Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) was suspended and
            he
            is been prosecuted for failing to declare his assets (properties and cash running into millions of dollars).
            Recently,
            the government anti-corruption fight paid-off as two former state Governors were convicted and sentenced to fourteen
            years in prison, respectively, on account of defrauding and/or embezzling funds belonging to their states.</p>
        <p>In addition, the private sector which was believed to be less corrupt has been found culpable, as certain firms were
            allegedly used to siphoned or launder stolen monies by government officials. In line with this, some banks’
            executives
            have been arraigned while others have been convicted. Similarly, foreign firms operating in Nigeria such as
            Halliburton
            and Sagem have been fingered in corruption related cases in the past. Moreover, the various reports of reputable
            international organisations such as the Transparency International (TI), Political Risk Service Group (PRS) and the
            World Bank (WB) have suggested that corruption thrives in Nigeria, with public officials using their power of office
            for
            private gain. In particular, the TI corruption perception index and ranking, the PRS International Country Risk
            Guide
            (ICRG) corruption index and the WB control of corruption indicator over the years show that Nigeria is one of the
            most
            corrupt nations in the world.
        
            Despite its negative consequences, economists are yet to properly understand the steps that should be taken to
            reduce
            corruption (Ades & Di Tella, 1997). Furthermore, whereas researchers have established that corruption influences
            certain
            macroeconomic variables which include trade, underdevelopment, savings, investment, and growth, they have paid less
            attention to corruption determinants until recently (for example see Ali & Isee, 2003; Swaleheen, 2008; Zhang, Cao,
            &
            Vaughn, 2009). Moreover, most studies that were conducted to ascertain the determinants of corruption focused on a
            group
            of countries, employing either cross-section or panel data (see Ades & Di Tella, 1997; Ali & Isee, 2003; Elbahnasawy
            &
            Revier, 2012; Evrensel, 2010; Fisman & Gatti, 2002; Goel & Nelson, 2005; Iwasaki & Suzuki, 2012; Park, 2003; Serra,
            2006; Triesman, 2000, 2007; Zhang et al., 2009).</p>

        <h1 name="top"></h1>
        <h2 id="article 2"> SECTION 2</h2>
        <p>Additionally, empirical research on the determinants of corruption at individual country level is very scanty.
            Interestingly, Nguyen and van Dijk (2012) advocated for country-specific studies on corruption, because it can aid
            our
            understanding on why and how corruption affects the economy, and therefore provide policy prescription to
            governments to
            remedy the situation. In the same vein, Ali and Isee (2003) opined that once the main drivers of corruption have
            been
            established, appropriate policy conclusions can be drawn from an empirical exercise, leading to the design and
            implementation of policies to checking and/or reducing the harmful impacts of corruption. Furthermore, Athukorala
            and
            Sen (2004) argued that cross sectional studies are based on highly restrictive assumptions, and any results from
            them
            might not be acceptable by all. Therefore, they emphasised the need for studies that are country-specific.
        <p></p>
        Despite the high level of corruption in Nigeria, little has been done to empirically examine the determinants of
        corruption. Although the recent study by Akinpelu, Ogunseye, Bada, and Agbeyangi (2013) on the determinants of
        corruption in Nigeria deserves some commendations, however, the study has certain weaknesses. In particular, the authors
        employed the Johansen’s cointegration approach even though the variables used in their analysis had a mixture of I(0)
        and I(1). In addition, the authors employed a small sample size. We believed that an appropriate estimation technique
        should be the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) method. Also, it is a known fact that using time series data for
        estimation purpose can lead to problems such as serial-correlation and heteroscedasticity. But Akinpelu et al. (2013)
        did not conduct any of these diagnostic tests making one to doubt the reliability of the reported results. Moreover,
        factors such as political rights and civil liberties that have been found to be important determinants of corruption in
        the literature were left out by Akinpelu et al. (2013).
        <p></p>
        The present study is important and contributes to the existing literature for a number of reasons. First, this study
        employs different methods of analysis namely the ARDL, Canonical Cointegration Regression (CCR) and Fully Modified
        Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) to examine the determinants of corruption in Nigeria from 1984 to 2016. These methods
        have several advantages over the conventional cointegration technique used by Akinpelu et al. (2013). These advantages
        are discussed in the econometric techniques section of this study. In addition, by using several estimation techniques
        (i.e., ARDL, CCR and FMOLS), we can ascertain the consistency and robustness of the results. Second, this study performs
        diagnostic tests including serial-correlation and heteroscedasticity, which Akinpelu et al. (2013) failed to conduct to
        check the reliability of the results generated. Third, this study is the first to explore the role of political rights
        and civil liberties on corruption in Nigeria. Fourth, once the main factors that are responsible for high corruption in
        Nigeria have been established, then we can suggest appropriate policies to reduce corruption in Nigeria.
        <p></p>
        The objective of this study is to examine the determinants of corruption in Nigeria. Following the introduction, section
        two is the theoretical and empirical literature review. The third section consists of the model formulation and the
        data. Section four is the econometric techniques while results and discussion are taken up in the fifth section. The
        sixth section is for conclusion.</p>
        <p>There is no comprehensive theory that explains the linkage between corruption and its potential determinants. This
            makes
            it a bit difficult to come up with a theoretical model or employ an empirical method that is agreed to all
            researchers
            in examining the factors that affect corruption (Alt & Lassen, 2003; Goel & Nelson, 2011). Nevertheless, researchers
            have relied on a few theories when attempting to investigate the determinants of corruption. One of the theories is
            the
            tax compliance theory (Mookherjee & Png, 1989; Reinganum & Wilde, 1985). The theory proposes that one way to reduce
            corruption is through appropriate levels of auditing. Another theory that has been employed is the compensation
            theory
            (Becker & Stigler, 1974). The theory argues that payment of wages/salaries above the market clearing wages/salaries
            including monitoring the activities of the agents (government officials) from time to time can help to control
            corruption. There is also the social support theory (Cullen, 1994) which has its root in Lin’s (1986) theory of
            mental
            illness and Braithwaite’s (1989) theory of shaming and reintegration. The theory suggests that high levels of social
            support raise citizens’ wellbeing and as a result lower crime rates (corruption) in a society.</p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        This study examines the determinants of corruption in Nigeria, from 1984 to 2016. Using the bounds testing method to
        cointegration, the results show that there is a long-run relationship between corruption and its determinants (economic
        development, political rights and civil liberties, military expenditure, rents, and openness). The results of the ARDL,
        CCR and FMOLS estimation illustrate the main determinants of corruption in Nigeria in the long-run to include economic
        development, political rights civil liberties, military expenditure, rents and openness. Greater economic development,
        more civil liberties and openness, as well as increases in military expenditure reduce corruption, while increases in
        rents and greater political rights encourage corruption in the long-run. Furthermore, economic development, civil
        liberties and openness have a reducing impact on corruption, while political rights, military expenditure, and oil rents
        encourage corruption in Nigeria in the short-run. Based on these findings, this study recommends policies that will
        promote economic development, civil liberties and openness, including reducing the reliance on the oil sector to curb
        corruption in Nigeria.
        <p></p>
        In particular, government and policymakers should employ policies to promote economic development so as to reduce
        corruption. This can be achieved via increased investment in public works and infrastructure. In addition, efforts
        should be made to boost (and sustain growth of) domestic production of goods and services. These will lead to employment
        creation as well as raising income generating opportunities, and as a result lower corruption.
        <p></p>
        Second, government should promote civil liberties and freedom of speech. This will encourage the citizens to not only
        demand for accountability and transparency, but also to expose corrupt government officials. In addition, although
        political rights appear not to lower corruption in the long-run, authorities should promote political rights. Greater
        political rights will promote political competition, and encourage citizens to vote and/or be voted for. In addition,
        electorate can punish corrupt officials via voting them out of office or making sure they are not re-elected.
        <p></p>
        Third, while one will expect that a policy of reducing military expenditure is required to curb corruption, the ongoing
        security challenges and attacks on many communities by insurgents, including kidnapping and cattle rustling, among other
        things, demand an increase in military spending in Nigeria. Proper funding of the military will help to restore peace in
        Nigeria. Relative peace will promote economic activities and raise income over the long term. As stated earlier, when
        people earn high income they will be reluctant to engage in corrupt acts. In addition, government should ensure that due
        process is followed during contracts bidding, approvals and awards with respect to military purchases.
        <p></p>
        Fourth, efforts should be geared towards diversifying the economy to reduce Nigeria’s reliance on the oil sector as a
        major revenue earner to the government. In addition, the state-owned oil corporation (NNPC) should be encouraged to
        embrace transparency and accountability in its entire operations. This will results in a reduction in rent-seeking
        behaviour and corrupt practices which have become a common feature of the oil sector in Nigeria.
        <p></p>
        Last, government should take steps to open up the economy more and expose domestic firms to foreign competition. Greater
        competition in turn will reduce rent-seeking behaviour and corruption.</p>
