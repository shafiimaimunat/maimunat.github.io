	<p><h2>history of Telecommunication</h2>
The word telecommunications come from the Greek prefix tele-, which means "distant," combined with the Latin word communicare, which means "to share." Important telecommunication technologies include the telegraph, telephone, radio, television, videotelephony, satellites, closed computer networks and the public internet.

<li>1876. The first telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell. This early model required an interpreter, or telegrapher, at both ends. These first telephones were intercom systems, where two phones were connected directly.</li>

<li>1891. Dial telephones were invented, which bypassed the need for an operator on each call. This made it much quicker and easier to make calls via telephone.</li>


	<p>Data is transmitted in a telecommunications circuit by means of an electrical signal called the carrier or the carrier wave. In order for a carrier to convey information, some form of modulation is required. The mode of modulation can broadly be categorized as either analog or digital.
In analog modulation, some aspect of the carrier is varied in a continuous fashion. The oldest form of analog modulation is amplitude modulation (AM), which is still used in radio broadcasting at some frequencies. Digital modulation actually predates AM; the earliest form was Morse code. Modern telecommunications use internet protocols to carry data across underlying physical transmissions.
